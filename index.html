    <h1 class="spacedout">Teen Sues YouTube For Showing Him An Unskippable Ad</h1>
    <p class="textSection">
      KATY-A young teenager at Tompkins has finally had enough of the unskippable YouTube ads that have "wasted" much
      of the precious time he could have been using to watch more Minecraft Let's Play videos. "I will never get those
      five seconds back" says the junior of the ads he gets that interrupt his "only free time of the day."
</p>
<p class="textSection">
      While online sources point to adblock as a possible solution, this particular teen remains dissatisfied with the
      manner in which YouTube works. "I can't download an adblock on my phone" claims the young teen, further conveying his
      disappointment with the video streaming service in asserting that this is "lowkey annoying" and exclaiming that "its
      like they want money or something" in an interview with our crew earlier today.
    </p>
<p class="textSection">
      The teen goes on to explain what his life had the potential to be like if his time was better spent, placing full blame
      on YouTube and their ads rather than his own addiction to gaming videos. "I would have invested in Bitcoin bro, but those
      five seconds of YouTube ads on a tutorial distracted me" claims the young man, who indicates that he would have been "the
      world's first trillionaire" if not for "those moneygrabbers at YouTube".
</p>
<p class="textSection">
      So far the company has taken to negotiating out of court, but the Tompkins student is not content with such a resolution. "We need
      an amendment to the Constitution!" exclaims the teen, ending off the interview by calling all MLG gamers to come forth and join him
      in a virtual march at a Fortnite recreation of the White House. "We must do what we can to improve the quality of life of all
      oppressed gamers out there. Give us our five seconds or give us death!"
</p>
<p class="textSection mb-3">
      We will continue to put out more information on the ongoing court case as details come along, but as it stands the
      YouTube representatives refuse to comment on the issue.
